# nextjs-website
Portfolio website created with next-js + react. A framework that I played around with and liked the syntax and its capabilities. So I decided to go for a project.

# Website
I created this website for a friend.

# Structure
The project was divided into 3 main folders: components, pages, and static. 
The components folder has JavaScript components such as Navbar, Carousel, Footer, etc. Meanwhile, the ```pages``` folder has pages made up with those components. Linking is done automatically thanks to Next.js, which I used. The ```static``` folder has the css resources and the images used in the Carousel and the gallery.
